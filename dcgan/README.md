This is a project intended to create a new GAN Network for Image Generation. FasGAN is based on Fas14MNet network and DCGAN architecture using Vanilla gradient loss.

Steps to run:

1. from fasgan.generator import Generator

2. from fasgan.discriminator import Discriminator

3. netG = Generator()

4. netD = Discriminator()
